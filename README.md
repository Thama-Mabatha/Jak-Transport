# JAK Move – React & ASP.NET Core Application  
### A 3-Tier Transport and Moving Management Platform

## Description

### What is it:
This project is a web and mobile-based system called **JAK Move**, developed in 2024 for **JAK Transport**.  
JAK Move is a transport and moving management platform that allows customers to request moving quotes, book jobs, track deliveries in real time, and make payments online.

In addition to customer booking functionality, the system includes:
- A driver mobile application for managing assigned jobs and updating delivery progress  
- A manager dashboard for job oversight, pricing control, payment approval, reporting, and fleet management  

The platform automates manual transport processes, improving efficiency, transparency, and communication between customers, drivers, and management.

### Why was it built:
This project was built to gain practical experience in designing and implementing a **3-tier system**.  
The goal was to learn web technologies using **React** for the frontend and **ASP.NET Core Web APIs** for the backend, while integrating a relational database.

This was built as a **university group project** to learn collaboration, real-world system design, and separation of concerns in a scalable system.
